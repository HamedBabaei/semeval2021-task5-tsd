"The parallels between the ANC and the Sicilian Mafia are glaring. The ANC has always been run by a few ""families"" who treat the state as 'turf' ; as just one big piggy bank for their self-enrichment. The government basically believes we all just work for them. They aren't a democratic government at all, but use the appearances of democracy to give their entitlement practices a mask of legitimacy. The poor and ignorant have been fooled for so long, but people are slowly coming to the ANC for what it is: a self-serving Mafia!",[]
"Intel Community: ‘How can we work for a President who Undermines our work?’

Days before taking office, he compared America’s spies to Adolf Hitler’s Gestapo.

American spies do not like having their work dismissed by the president. Nor do they appreciate comparisons to Nazi Germany.

Former CIA Director John Brennan made it clear: “The person who said that should be ashamed of himself,” Brennan said.

Coats’ predecessor, Gen. James Clapper, called Trump’s comments “a terrible, insulting affront … completely inappropriate.”

Trump’s opinions are out of step with the conclusions of the agencies he is supposed to be leading.

The other big takeaway is that it would have been a massacre had there not been an armed security detail present to return fire and kill the assailant. High ranking politicians (including Democrats) have armed security details, but ordinary citizens do not. Hawaii Democrats deny ordinary citizens their constitutional right to self-defense with firearms, including concealed carry. Hypocrites!

The fewer collectors of a tax the better, and there are much fewer businesses to collect a sales tax than there are residents, who may or may not honestly pay an income tax There are a LOT of income tax cheaters and to enforce collection of income tax requires a new State agency. 
Auditing businesses who collect sales tax is very straightforward and very few businesses of any size cheat on sales taxes. 
As a person increases their income, they buy more expensive items, therefore they pay more sales tax, Most states eliminate groceries from sales tax, so as to not unfairly hit the poor, so the sales tax is on items people CHOOSE to buy.

"The best thing Canada can do for its high tech industries is to vote out the likes of Junior, Wynne and Notley..  They are doing more to hurt the high tech and manufacturing industries that help it. They have imposed higher taxes on Canada's highest income earners.  Paying over 50% of your income on taxes is insane.   That effects skilled high tech entrepreneurs, managers, engineer, IT programmers, etc.  Already, the U.S. taxation is far lower for well-paid high tech staff.  More so for other countries like Ireland, Singapore, Hong Kong, etc.  That gap is going to get wider as Trump is going to lower taxes.  It now looks like Junior may impose higher capital gains taxes which again is stupid as many high tech staff count stock share options as part of their pay.    Combine that with carbon taxes and high energy bills.  .  That also badly effects manufacturing. Trudeau, Wynne and Notley are running huge deficits with no end in sight.  There is no end in sight with their stupidity.",[]

My observation is that passengers are becoming increasingly  disrespectful to the airline personnel and their fellow passengers.  I've seen it all the way from parents allowing thier kids to run up an down the isle, to people putting thier feet up on another passengers seat handles.  If people woudl just remember to treat others as you would want to be treated our travel experiences would all be better.

Plaster was a major thing - it has ZERO survival value. It takes days of backbreaking labour, maintaining a fire at very high heat constantly - for no reward other than aesthetics. It's something that would never have happened in a society without an abundance of leisure time. And it's important that it did - the same fire-handling techniques they developed to make their walls smooth - was what allowed their grandchildren to smelt ore and end the stone age.

"Why does this author think she can demand, or is owed anything from either of these two people? One guy is a goon, the other is illiterate. They aren't law makers, teachers, or in any kind moral authority position. They are entertainers who get punched for her pleasure, and will likely live out their days mentally debilitated from the repeated blows to the head.

Do we get to comb deeply through this authors personal history and determine all the groups she owes apologies or explanations to? Why not? As an opinion maker in a national news paper and instructor of young people, she has far, far more influence on Canadians than two ignorant punchies.

The arrogance of these pseudo-intellectual academics is astounding. Since they are so enlightened and pure, YOU owe THEM an explanation and an apology as to why you're so dumb and ignorant.","[828, 829, 830, 831]"
