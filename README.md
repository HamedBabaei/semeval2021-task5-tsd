In this paper, we presented our approach for SemEval-2021 Task 5: Toxic Span Detection. We tried to tackle the problem by employing multi-embedding and deep learning techniques. We conducted some experiments using different models. For example, we implemented a BiLSTM model, BiLSTM with SA, BiGRU, and BiGRU with SA, but the model that gave a promising result and relied on it was BiGRU with SA model.
